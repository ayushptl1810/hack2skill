    "body": "It's true that statistics about recent policy changes are frequently shared on social media platforms. Our fact-check finds this claim to be partially verified because while the basic figures often shared are indeed accurate, the problem lies in the *context* surrounding them. \n\nExperts from Reuters, BBC, and AP News consistently highlight that these social media posts often present data in an oversimplified way, missing crucial background information. For example, a statistic showing an increase or decrease in a certain metric might be accurate for a specific period, but without historical data, a broader economic picture, or information about other contributing factors, the statistic alone can be misleading.\n\nPolicy changes rarely operate in a vacuum; their impacts are often complex and influenced by many variables. Presenting a single data point without explaining what it means in a larger scenario, or failing to acknowledge the time frame and limitations of the data, can lead to inaccurate conclusions about the policy's true effectiveness or impact. \n\nSo, while it's accurate that the numbers themselves may be correct, the way they are presented often gives an incomplete or skewed understanding of the full story. Always seek out additional information from multiple, reputable sources to understand the 'why' and 'how' behind a statistic, rather than just the 'what.'",
