    "body": "Social media posts often highlight stats about recent policy changes, but frequently lack crucial context. While the numbers themselves might be accurate, the complete picture is usually more nuanced. For example, a claim might highlight an increase in a specific statistic after a policy change, without mentioning pre-existing trends, external factors also contributing, or offsetting positive effects. Reuters, BBC, and AP News have all noted examples of this. This doesn't automatically mean the information is false, but it does mean it's potentially misleading. To get the full story, consult multiple reliable sources, look for explanations of contributing factors, and be wary of claims that present a single statistic as conclusive evidence. Be skeptical of posts lacking diverse perspectives.",
    "summary": "Statistics shared online about policy changes often lack crucial context, making the overall situation appear more straightforward than it actually is."
