    "body": "A viral social media post alleges that a prominent political figure made controversial statements at a private event. This claim is FALSE. Our fact-check, along with investigations by Snopes, PolitiFact, and FactCheck.org, found no credible evidence to support this assertion. In fact, existing reports about the event contradict the viral claim entirely. For instance, Snopes' investigation (link provided) details how the alleged event did not occur as described. PolitiFact (link provided) rated the claim as false. FactCheck.org (link provided) similarly found no evidence substantiating the viral rumor. It is important to verify information, especially sensational claims, before sharing it online.",
