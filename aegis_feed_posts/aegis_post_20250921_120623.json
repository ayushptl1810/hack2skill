    "body": "Claims circulating online cite statistics related to recent policy changes. While the numbers themselves are often accurate *on the surface*, the crucial context surrounding them is frequently omitted, leading to potential misinterpretations. For example, a post might highlight an increase in a particular metric without mentioning pre-existing trends or external factors that also influenced the change. Our fact-checks, drawing from Reuters, BBC, and AP News, confirm that the core figures are often valid, but the narrative built around them is incomplete. These sources reveal alternative explanations and data points that paint a more nuanced picture. It's essential to seek information from diverse and reputable outlets before drawing conclusions based solely on social media posts. While the information isn't *false*, it is presented in a way that is misleading. Because of the missing context and potential for misinterpretation, we rate this claim as Partially Verified.",
    "summary": "While policy-related statistics shared online may be factually accurate, they often lack crucial context, making the overall claim misleading and requiring further investigation."
